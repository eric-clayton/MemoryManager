# MemoryManager
Memory manager written in C++. I created this as a school project that tests the algorithm of best fit and first fit for allocating memory to a dynamic char array. 
The program was tested for memory leaks using Valgrind.

To run on windows or linux:
Clone the repo
open a terminal in the same directory as the makefile
Type `make`
Run `./MemoryManager`
